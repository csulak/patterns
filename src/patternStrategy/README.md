# 🎯 Strategy Pattern Example

This project demonstrates the Strategy Pattern using a payment processing system example. It includes both implementations - with and without the pattern - to showcase the benefits of using the Strategy Pattern.

## 📚 What is the Strategy Pattern?

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### 🌟 Key Benefits of Strategy Pattern

1. **Flexibility and Reusability**
   - Easily swap algorithms at runtime
   - Reuse strategy objects across different contexts
   - Combine strategies to create composite behaviors

2. **Clean Code and Maintainability**
   - Eliminates complex conditional statements
   - Each strategy is isolated and self-contained
   - Reduces code duplication
   - Makes the code more readable and organized

3. **SOLID Principles Compliance**
   - Single Responsibility Principle: Each strategy handles one specific algorithm
   - Open/Closed Principle: New strategies can be added without modifying existing code
   - Liskov Substitution Principle: Strategies are interchangeable
   - Interface Segregation: Clean interface definition
   - Dependency Inversion: High-level modules depend on abstractions

4. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Test strategies in isolation
   - Easy to mock strategies for testing
   - Simplified debugging process
   - Better unit test coverage

5. **Scalability**
   - Easy to add new algorithms
   - No need to modify existing code
   - Reduced risk of introducing bugs
   - Supports application growth
